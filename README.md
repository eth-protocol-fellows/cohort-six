### Calls

There will be two regular weekly calls throughout the program. 

#### Standup calls 

Standup calls provide an opportunity to share your progress and meet other fellows. These calls serve to discuss regular updates, current issues participants are facing, their open questions and comments raised in development updates. Standup calls are dedicated to participants and their discussion, some mentors might show up occasionally. Standups occur weekly every Monday, 15:00 UTC. Use [this link](https://meet.ethereum.org/epf-standup) to attend.

#### Office hours

In addition to the weekly standup calls, we hold Office Hours calls which can be focused on specific topics proposed in advance. Find the upcoming call agenda in [Issues](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six/issues). Anybody can propose topics for this call by commenting on its tracking issue. Office Hours are regularly happening on every Wednesday, 15:00 UTC at [this link](https://meet.ethereum.org/epf-office-hours).
